Move better, feel lighter, and unlock your full range of motion.
This mobility class blends yoga, mindful movement, and breathwork to gently improve joint health, flexibility, and strength. Perfect for easing stiffness, preventing injury, and helping your body move with more freedom—on the mat and in everyday life. Suitable for all levels.

I am a yoga instructor and wellness coach. I am trying to help you with your yoga, meditation, and spiritual journey for a healthy and balanced lifestyle. 
Join me on the mat for a journey of breath, strength, and serenity. As a certified yoga teacher, I'm passionate about sharing the transformative power of this ancient practice.

I support expecting mothers through gentle, mindful prenatal yoga designed to nurture both body and baby. My sessions focus on safe movement, breath awareness, and relaxation techniques that ease common pregnancy discomforts, build strength and confidence, and create a deeper connection with your growing baby. Each practice is adaptable, supportive, and centred around your changing needs throughout pregnancy.
Learners can expect to gain greater comfort, strength, and calm throughout pregnancy. Through gentle movement and guided breathing, you’ll build confidence in your changing body, reduce stress and tension, and develop tools to support both pregnancy and birth.


My journey into yoga began during a time when I was searching for balance—physically, mentally, and emotionally. What started as a simple practice to relieve stress soon became a powerful tool for healing, self-awareness, and inner strength. Through yoga, I learned to listen to my body, move with intention, and breathe through life’s challenges both on and off the mat.
Over the years, my personal practice deepened into a calling to teach. I pursued advanced yoga training with a strong focus on anatomy, breathwork, and mindful movement, and later specialised in prenatal yoga after witnessing the profound impact it can have on expecting mothers. Supporting women through pregnancy—helping them feel strong, calm, and connected during such a transformative time—has become the heart of my work.
Today, I bring together years of dedicated practice, ongoing education, and lived experience to create safe, nurturing yoga spaces where learners feel supported at every stage of their journey. My teaching is grounded in compassion, adaptability, and the belief that yoga is for every body.

Hi Ian, 
I am looking at Airwallex as a solution in my marketplace SaaS application. I already have a stripe implementation, and that works fine for the most part. But, their Stripe Connect solution does not work great for India. 
India is important, as I expect a large portion of our vendor base to be in India.  

I am now considering Airwallex (as an alternative for Stripe connect)   
Is there a way for me to access sandbox env without a registered business? I am a solo founder, and am in the process of setting up my business.

Thanks, Arun

⏺ Google Meet Auto-Import: Possible but Harder

  Comparison: Zoom vs Google Meet

  | Feature                       | Zoom                   | Google Meet                   |
  |-------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|
  | Recording API                 | ✅ Direct download URL | ❌ Stored in Google Drive     |
  | Webhook for "recording ready" | ✅ recording.completed | ✅ recording.v2.fileGenerated |
  | Download recording            | ✅ Simple API call     | ⚠️ Requires Drive API         |
  | API scope                     | Normal OAuth           | Restricted scope ($$$)        |
  | Start recording via API       | ✅ Yes                 | ❌ No (manual only)           |

  The Google Meet Challenge

  Expert records Google Meet
          ↓
  Recording saved to their Google Drive
          ↓
  Webhook: recording.v2.fileGenerated  ✅ Works!
          ↓
  Download via Drive API  ❌ PROBLEM
          ↓
  Drive readonly = RESTRICTED SCOPE
          ↓
  Requires Google security review
  $15,000-75,000 + 2-6 months

  ---
  Options for Google Meet

  Option 1: Full Integration (Expensive)

  | Requirement                   | Details                       |
  |-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
  | Google Workspace Events API   | Subscribe to recording events |
  | Google Drive API              | Download recordings           |
  | Restricted scope verification | $15K-75K security audit       |
  | Timeline                      | 2-6 months                    |

  Not recommended unless you have significant budget.

  ---
  Option 2: Manual Export Flow (Free)

  Expert records on Google Meet
          ↓
  Recording appears in their Drive
          ↓
  Expert clicks "Add to Library" in your app
          ↓
  Expert pastes Google Drive share link
          ↓
  Your app imports via public share link

  Cost: $0
  Effort: Low (just UI for link input)
  UX: Manual step for expert

  ---
  Option 3: Google Workspace Add-on

  Build a Google Workspace add-on that runs in expert's context:

  Add-on installed in expert's Google Workspace
          ↓
  Listens for new recordings in Meet Recordings folder
          ↓
  Add-on uploads to your platform (using expert's auth)
          ↓
  No restricted scope needed (runs as user)

  Cost: Free
  Effort: Medium (build add-on)
  Limitation: Expert must install add-on

  ---
  Option 4: Use Third-Party Service

  | Service      | How it works                 | Cost               |
  |--------------|------------------------------|--------------------|
  | Recall.ai    | Bot joins meeting, records   | ~$0.02/min         |
  | Nylas        | Unified calendar + recording | Enterprise pricing |
  | Fireflies.ai | Bot joins + transcribes      | $19/user/month     |

  Recommendation: Dual BYO Strategy

  Zoom: Full Auto-Import

  Zoom OAuth connected
          ↓
  Webhook: recording.completed
          ↓
  Lambda downloads + uploads to Cloudflare
          ↓
  Fully automatic ✅

  Google Meet: Semi-Auto Import

  Google OAuth connected (Calendar scope only - not restricted)
          ↓
  Create Google Meet links via Calendar API ✅
          ↓
  After meeting, expert clicks "Import Recording"
          ↓
  Expert pastes Drive share link
          ↓
  Lambda downloads shared file + uploads to Cloudflare

  Cost Summary

  | Provider    | Auto-Import               | Cost  | Effort    |
  |-------------|---------------------------|-------|-----------|
  | Zoom        | ✅ Fully automatic        | $0    | Medium    |
  | Google Meet | ⚠️ Semi-auto (paste link) | $0    | Low       |
  | Google Meet | ✅ Full auto (add-on)     | $0    | High      |
  | Google Meet | ✅ Full auto (restricted) | $15K+ | Very High |

  Implementation Plan

  | Phase   | Feature                               | Effort |
  |---------|---------------------------------------|--------|
  | Phase 1 | Zoom auto-import (webhook + download) | 2 days |
  | Phase 2 | Google Meet link import (paste URL)   | 1 day  |
  | Phase 3 | (Optional) Google Workspace add-on    | 1 week |

  Want me to plan the implementation for Phase 1 (Zoom) and Phase 2 (Google Meet paste)?

  | Google Meet | ❌ No recording at all       | ✅ Cloud to Drive  | ⚠️ Semi-auto       |

  ---
  Zoom Recording Requirements

  | Account Type | Cloud Recording    | Local Recording | Cost      |
  |--------------|--------------------|-----------------|-----------|
  | Free (Basic) | ❌ No              | ⚠️ 40 min limit | $0        |

  The Problem

  Most yoga instructors starting out will have:
  - Free Gmail (no Meet recording)
  - Free Zoom (no cloud recording, 40 min limit)

  This means auto-import won't work for beginners.

  ---
  Solutions

  Option A: Require Paid Accounts (Current BYOZ)

  - Only works for established experts
  - Limits your market to professionals
  - Cost to you: $0

  Option B: Platform-Provided Recording

  Provide your own video solution for experts without paid accounts:

  | Solution       | Cost/Expert/Month | Notes                      |
  |----------------|-------------------|----------------------------|
  | Zoom Video SDK | ~$12-15           | Build custom, usage-based  |
  | Jitsi + Jibri  | ~$2               | Self-hosted, complex ops   |
  | Daily.co       | ~$10-15           | Easy API, usage-based      |
  | 100ms          | ~$10-15           | Good features, usage-based |

  Option C: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)

  Expert has paid Zoom/Meet? → Use their account (BYOZ) → Auto-import
                  ↓
  Expert has free account? → Use platform video → Auto-record

  | Tier         | What Expert Gets             | Your Cost    |
  |--------------|------------------------------|--------------|
  | Free experts | Platform video (Jitsi/Daily) | ~$2-5/expert |
  | Pro experts  | BYOZ + auto-import           | $0           |

  ---
  Cost Comparison for 100 Experts

  | Scenario                | Assumption        | Monthly Cost |
  |-------------------------|-------------------|--------------|
  | All have paid Zoom      | 100% BYOZ         | $0           |
  | 50% paid, 50% free      | Hybrid with Jitsi | ~$100-250    |
  | All need platform video | Daily.co/100ms    | ~$1,500      |

  ---
  Recommendation

  Short term: Keep BYOZ (works for serious experts who already have paid accounts)

  Medium term: Add Jitsi self-hosted as fallback for free-tier experts (~$150-200/month for servers)

  Long term: Evaluate if free experts convert enough to justify platform-provided video

  Want me to research Jitsi self-hosted setup and costs?

  Two Tiers

  | Tier          | Expert Has      | Platform Provides              | Monthly Fee |
  |---------------|-----------------|--------------------------------|-------------|
  | BYOZ          | Paid Zoom/Meet  | Auto-import recordings         | $0          |
  | Platform Zoom | No paid account | Zoom Pro license + auto-import | ~$15        |

  Cost/Revenue per Expert

  | Item              | BYOZ Expert  | Platform Zoom Expert |
  |-------------------|--------------|----------------------|
  | Revenue           | $0           | $15/month            |
  | Your Zoom cost    | $0           | -$15.99/month        |
  | Cloudflare Stream | -$0.60/month | -$0.60/month         |
  | Net               | -$0.60       | -$1.59               |

  Note: At $15/month you're subsidizing slightly (-$1.59), but gaining:
  - Stickiness (expert depends on your platform)
  - Upsell opportunity
  - Better UX for beginners

  Alternative: Charge $18-20/month to be profitable on this tier.

  What Needs to Be Built

  | Feature                                   | Effort  | Priority |
  |-------------------------------------------|---------|----------|
  | Zoom webhook for recording.completed      | 1 day   | High     |
  | Lambda to download + upload to Cloudflare | 1 day   | High     |
  | "Add to Course" UI for recordings         | 1 day   | High     |
  | Platform Zoom license management          | 2 days  | Medium   |
  | Billing integration ($15/mo tier)         | 1 day   | Medium   |
  | Google Meet paste-link fallback           | 0.5 day | Low      |

  Total: ~6-7 days development

  Platform Zoom License Options

  | Approach              | How It Works                               | Complexity     |
  |-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------|
  | Buy licenses manually | Purchase Zoom Pro seats, assign to experts | Low            |
  | Zoom ISV Program      | Programmatic provisioning via API          | High ($2K min) |
  | Reseller account      | Bulk discount, manage sub-accounts         | Medium         |

  Recommendation: Start with manual license purchase (buy 10-20 seats), scale to ISV if demand grows.
