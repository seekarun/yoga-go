# Subscription Payment Flow - Testing Guide

## What Was Implemented

✅ **Subscription payment flow** fully integrated with Stripe
✅ **Works with test credentials** (current setup) and production (just swap env vars)
✅ **Cancel/Reactivate subscription** buttons now functional in profile page

## Files Modified

1. **`src/components/payment/StripeCheckout.tsx`**
   - Added subscription-specific props (`planType`, `billingInterval`)
   - Implemented separate flow for subscription payments
   - Calls `/api/payment/stripe/create-subscription` API
   - Confirms subscription payment with Stripe Elements
   - Keeps existing one-time payment flow for course purchases

2. **`src/components/payment/PaymentModal.tsx`**
   - Passes subscription details to StripeCheckout component
   - Already had `type="subscription"` from pricing page

3. **`.env.example`**
   - Added all required Stripe subscription price IDs
   - Added Razorpay subscription plan IDs (optional)
   - Documented test vs production setup

## Setup Required Before Testing

### 1. Create Stripe Subscription Products (Test Mode)

You need to create subscription price IDs in your Stripe Dashboard (test mode):

**Steps:**

1. Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products
2. Click "**Add Product**"

**Curious Plan - Monthly USD:**

- Name: `Curious Plan - Monthly USD`
- Price: `$35.00` per month
- Billing: `Recurring`
- Copy the price ID (starts with `price_`) to `.env.local`:
  ```
  STRIPE_CURIOUS_MONTHLY_USD_PRICE_ID=price_xxxxx
  ```

**Curious Plan - Yearly USD:**

- Name: `Curious Plan - Yearly USD`
- Price: `$299.00` per year
- Billing: `Recurring`
- Copy price ID to `.env.local`:
  ```
  STRIPE_CURIOUS_YEARLY_USD_PRICE_ID=price_xxxxx
  ```

**Repeat for:**

- Committed Plan - Monthly USD: `$69.00/month`
- Committed Plan - Yearly USD: `$599.00/year`
- Curious Plan - Monthly INR: `₹299/month`
- Curious Plan - Yearly INR: `₹2,499/year`
- Committed Plan - Monthly INR: `₹699/month`
- Committed Plan - Yearly INR: `₹4,999/year`

**Note:** For INR prices, enter the amount in rupees (Stripe handles the conversion to paise automatically).

### 2. Configure Webhook (for local testing)

Use Stripe CLI to forward webhooks to your local server:

```bash
# Install Stripe CLI: https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli
stripe login

# Forward webhooks to your local server
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3111/api/payment/stripe/webhook

# This will output a webhook signing secret starting with whsec_
# Add it to your .env.local:
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxxxx
```

Keep this terminal running while testing!

## Testing the Complete Subscription Flow

### Step 1: Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
# Server starts on http://localhost:3111
```

### Step 2: Create a Subscription

1. **Go to pricing page:** http://localhost:3111/pricing
2. **Select billing interval:** Toggle between Monthly/Yearly
3. **Click "Get Started"** on Curious or Committed plan
4. **Payment modal opens** with subscription details

5. **Enter test card details:**
   - Card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - Expiry: Any future date (e.g., `12/25`)
   - CVC: Any 3 digits (e.g., `123`)
   - ZIP: Any 5 digits (e.g., `12345`)

6. **Click "Pay"** button
7. **Watch the console logs:**

   ```
   [DBG][stripe] Creating subscription...
   [DBG][stripe-subscription] Creating subscription: {...}
   [DBG][stripe] Subscription created, confirming payment...
   [DBG][stripe] Subscription payment succeeded: pi_xxxxx
   ```

8. **Success!** You should see:
   - ✅ Success message
   - Redirect to `/app/profile`
   - Subscription details visible in Membership tab

### Step 3: Verify Subscription in Stripe Dashboard

1. Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/subscriptions
2. You should see your new subscription with status "Active"
3. Click on it to see details (customer, payment method, billing cycle)

### Step 4: Check Webhook Events

In the terminal running `stripe listen`, you should see:

```
→ customer.subscription.created
→ invoice.payment_succeeded
→ customer.subscription.updated
```

These events update your database automatically.

### Step 5: Test Cancel Subscription

1. **Go to profile page:** http://localhost:3111/app/profile
2. **Click "Membership" tab** in sidebar
3. **You should now see "Cancel Subscription" button** (red, outlined)
4. **Click "Cancel Subscription"**
5. **Confirm the dialog**
6. **Success!** Button changes to "Reactivate Subscription" (green)
7. **Yellow alert appears:** "Your subscription will end on [date]"

### Step 6: Test Reactivate Subscription

1. **Click "Reactivate Subscription"** button
2. **Success!** Subscription is active again
3. **Button changes back** to "Cancel Subscription"
4. **Alert disappears**

### Step 7: Verify in Database

Check your MongoDB to see the subscription record:

```javascript
// Collection: subscriptions
{
  _id: "nanoid",
  userId: "user_id",
  planType: "curious",
  billingInterval: "yearly",
  status: "active",
  gateway: "stripe",
  gatewaySubscriptionId: "sub_xxxxx",
  currentPeriodEnd: ISODate("2026-01-26"),
  cancelAtPeriodEnd: false,
  // ... more fields
}
```

## Test Cards (Stripe Test Mode)

- **Success:** `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- **Declined:** `4000 0000 0000 0002`
- **3D Secure:** `4000 0027 6000 3184`
- **Insufficient funds:** `4000 0000 0000 9995`

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Stripe price ID not configured"

**Solution:** Make sure you've added all 8 price IDs to `.env.local` and restarted the dev server.

### Issue: Webhook events not processing

**Solution:** Ensure `stripe listen` is running and `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is set correctly.

### Issue: Cancel button not appearing

**Solution:** Make sure the subscription was created successfully and `user.membership.subscriptionId` is set in the database.

### Issue: Payment fails immediately

**Solution:** Check browser console for errors. Common causes:

- Stripe publishable key not set
- Price IDs not created in Stripe Dashboard
- Network issues

## Production Deployment

When ready to go live:

1. **Switch to production Stripe keys:**

   ```bash
   # .env.local (or production env)
   NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_xxxxx
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_xxxxx
   ```

2. **Create production price IDs** in Stripe Dashboard (live mode)

3. **Configure production webhook:**
   - Endpoint: `https://yourdomain.com/api/payment/stripe/webhook`
   - Events: All subscription events
   - Copy webhook secret to production env

4. **Test with real card** (small amounts first!)

5. **Monitor:** https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments
