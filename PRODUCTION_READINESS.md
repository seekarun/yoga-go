# Yoga-GO Production Readiness Plan

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-11
**Status:** Planning Phase

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive plan to take Yoga-GO from its current MVP state to a production-ready SaaS platform. The application currently has a solid foundation with Next.js 15, payment UI integration, and core features. However, it requires database implementation, authentication, video infrastructure, and production hardening to launch successfully.

**Timeline:** 6-10 weeks
**Estimated Monthly Operating Cost:** $66-316 (scales with usage)
**Team Size Recommended:** 1-2 developers

---

## Current State Analysis

### ‚úÖ What's Working

- **Framework:** Next.js 15 with App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Code Quality:** ESLint, Prettier, Husky pre-commit hooks
- **Data Structure:** Well-designed mock data (experts, courses, lessons)
- **Payment UI:** Razorpay/Stripe integration with geolocation-based routing
- **UI Routes:** Guest, authenticated, and expert portal pages implemented
- **API Structure:** RESTful API routes defined

### ‚ùå Critical Gaps

- **Database:** All data is in-memory mock data (src/data/mockData.ts)
- **Authentication:** Mock localStorage-based auth (src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx:23)
- **Payment Persistence:** Payment API routes have TODO placeholders (src/app/api/payment/razorpay/create-order/route.ts:45)
- **Video Infrastructure:** No video hosting/streaming solution
- **Email System:** No email notifications
- **Error Monitoring:** No error tracking or logging
- **Security:** Missing rate limiting, CSRF protection, input validation
- **Testing:** No automated tests
- **Deployment:** No CI/CD or production deployment configuration

### Monthly Costs

1Ô∏è‚É£ Mobile App with 100ms - YES! ‚úÖ

100ms supports native mobile apps with dedicated SDKs:

Available SDKs:

- iOS (Swift/Objective-C) - Native iPhone/iPad apps
- Android (Kotlin/Java) - Native Android apps
- React Native - Cross-platform (iOS + Android)
- Flutter - Cross-platform (iOS + Android)

Mobile App is Actually BETTER than Web:

- ‚úÖ Better performance (native code vs browser)
- ‚úÖ Better battery optimization
- ‚úÖ Background support (can minimize app and stay connected)
- ‚úÖ Picture-in-Picture mode
- ‚úÖ Push notifications when session starts
- ‚úÖ Better camera/mic control
- ‚úÖ No browser limitations

Example - React Native:

npm install @100mslive/react-native-hms
Same concepts, just native components instead of web.

So YES, if you build a yoga-go mobile app, 100ms will work even better!

---

2Ô∏è‚É£ Why AWS Account? - You DON'T Need It! ‚ùå

Short answer: You don't need AWS anymore since we switched to 100ms.

What We Removed:

- ‚ùå Amazon IVS (live streaming) - Replaced with 100ms
- ‚ùå IVS Chat - Replaced with 100ms built-in chat

What You're Currently Using:

- ‚úÖ 100ms - Video conferencing (NOT AWS)
- ‚úÖ MongoDB Atlas - Database (NOT AWS, it's MongoDB's cloud)
- ‚úÖ Auth0 - Authentication (NOT AWS, it's Auth0's cloud)
- ‚úÖ Cloudflare Stream - Pre-recorded videos (NOT AWS, it's Cloudflare)

The Confusion:

Your CLAUDE.md file mentions "AWS infrastructure" and "Stick to AWS free-tier" - this is outdated.
That was written when you were planning to use AWS services. Now you're using:

- 100ms for live video
- Cloudflare for recorded videos
- MongoDB Atlas for database
- Auth0 for login

None of these are AWS!

When You WOULD Need AWS:

Only if you want to:

1. Deploy your Next.js app to AWS EC2/ECS (but you could use Vercel instead)
2. Store recordings in AWS S3 (but you could use Cloudflare R2 instead)
3. Use AWS Lambda for serverless functions (Next.js has its own API routes)

Bottom line: AWS is optional, not required.

---

3Ô∏è‚É£ Expected Costs

üí∞ 100ms Pricing (What You're Using)

Free Tier:

- 10,000 minutes/month video conferencing
- 10,000 minutes/month live streaming
- 300 minutes/month recording
- 300 minutes/month transcription

What This Means:

- 10,000 participant-minutes = 166 hours of video
- If each session is 60 min with 5 students = 300 participant-minutes per session
- Free tier = ~33 yoga sessions per month

Paid Pricing (after free tier):
Video Conferencing: $0.004 per participant-minute
Audio Only: $0.001 per participant-minute (75% cheaper)
Recording: $0.0135 per minute
Live Streaming: $0.0012 per viewer-minute

Example Monthly Cost:
Scenario: 100 yoga sessions/month, avg 5 students, 60 min each
= 100 sessions √ó 5 students √ó 60 min
= 30,000 participant-minutes

Free tier covers: 10,000 minutes
You pay for: 20,000 minutes
Cost: 20,000 √ó $0.004 = $80/month

Scaling:
Light usage (10 sessions/month): FREE
Medium usage (50 sessions/month): $40/month
Heavy usage (100 sessions/month): $80/month
Very heavy (500 sessions/month): $480/month

üí° Cost Saving Tips:

1. Audio-only option for students (75% cheaper) - yoga doesn't always need student video
2. Limit session duration (charge per hour)
3. Use volume pricing: negotiate custom pricing at $5k+/month (up to 50% off)

---

üí∞ AWS Pricing (What You're NOT Using)

Since you removed AWS IVS and aren't using AWS infrastructure:

Current AWS costs: $0/month ‚úÖ

If you WERE using AWS IVS (old approach):
IVS Video Input (SD): $0.02 per stream-minute
IVS Video Delivery (SD): $0.015 per viewer-minute
IVS Chat: $0.0014 per message

Example:
60-min class with 5 students
Input: 60 min √ó $0.02 = $1.20
Delivery: 60 min √ó 5 students √ó $0.015 = $4.50
Total: $5.70 per session (vs $1.20 with 100ms)

100 sessions/month = $570 vs $80 with 100ms

AWS IVS is 7x more expensive than 100ms! That's why we switched.

---

üí∞ Other Services You're Using

MongoDB Atlas:
Free tier: 512MB storage (good for 1000s of users)
Paid: $9/month for 2GB (if you outgrow free tier)

Auth0:
Free tier: 7,500 active users/month
Paid: $35/month for 1,000 MAU (monthly active users)

Cloudflare Stream (pre-recorded videos):
$5/month + $1 per 1,000 minutes stored + $1 per 1,000 minutes watched
Very cheap for pre-recorded content

---

üìä Total Expected Monthly Costs

Startup Phase (0-100 users, 10-20 live sessions/month):

100ms: FREE (within free tier)
MongoDB: FREE (within free tier)
Auth0: FREE (within free tier)
Cloudflare: ~$10-20/month
Domain: ~$12/year
Hosting (Vercel): FREE

TOTAL: ~$10-20/month üéâ

Growth Phase (500 users, 100 live sessions/month):

100ms: $80/month
MongoDB: $9/month (if needed)
Auth0: FREE or $35/month (if >7,500 users)
Cloudflare: ~$30-50/month
Hosting: FREE (Vercel) or $20/month (if upgraded)

TOTAL: ~$120-200/month

Scale Phase (5,000 users, 500 live sessions/month):

100ms: $480/month
MongoDB: $57/month
Auth0: ~$175/month
Cloudflare: ~$100/month
Hosting: $20/month

TOTAL: ~$832/month

---

‚úÖ Summary

1. Mobile App: YES, 100ms works great on mobile apps (even better than web)
2. AWS Account: NO, you don't need it anymore since you're using 100ms
3. Expected Costs:
   - Starting out: ~$10-20/month (almost free!)
   - Growing (100 sessions/month): ~$120-200/month
   - 100ms is 7x cheaper than AWS IVS

Your current stack is perfect and cost-effective! üéâ
